  variables:
    description: |
      Variables to set for the terraform plan. This should be valid Terraform syntax - like a [variable definition file](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/values/variables#variable-definitions-tfvars-files).

      Variables set here override any given in `var_file`s.

  var_file:

      List of tfvars files to use, one per line.
      Paths should be relative to the GitHub Actions workspace
    required: false
  var:
    description: |
      Comma separated list of Terraform vars to set.
      This is deprecated due to the following limitations:
      - Only primitive types can be set with `var` - number, bool and string.
      - String values may not contain a comma.
      - Values set with `var` will be overridden by values contained in `var_file`s
      - Does not work with the `remote` backend
      You can change from `var` to `variables` by putting each variable on a separate line and ensuring each string value is quoted.
    required: false
    deprecationMessage: Use the variables input instead.

outputs:
  failure-reason:
    description: |
      When the job outcome is `failure` because the there are outstanding changes to apply, this will be set to 'changes-to-apply'.
      If the job fails for any other reason this will not be set.
      This can be used with the Actions expression syntax to conditionally run a step when there are changes to apply.
